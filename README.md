I had the opportunity to design and develop a personal website using basic HTML and CSS skills. The main goal of this project was to create a simple yet functional personal website that showcases my skills and acts as a portfolio for my web development journey.

Purpose: The website is designed as a personal portfolio to highlight my skills and projects. It acts as a digital introduction to my work and provides a platform to share my achievements and ongoing projects
